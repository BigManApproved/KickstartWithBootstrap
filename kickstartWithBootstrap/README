== Introduction ==
Kickstart is an extension for Grails in order to start your project with a good looking frontend. 
It provides adapted scaffolding templates for standard CRUD pages using the Bootstrap web page template by Twitter.

== Usage ==
After installation you can call "grails kickstartWithBootstrap" which will copy several files into your project. 
It will overwrite only few files (e.g., in conf, src, and views) - you should use it only on fresh new Grails projects. 

Afterwards create your domain classes (or copy them into the project) and generate contollers and views - they will
now use the Bootstrap framework!


== Notes: ==


* Currently, only tested with Grails 1.3.7!
* Does only use plain Bootstrap (currently, without Less).
* The plugin copies the files into your project - you can uninstall the plugin thereafter.
* It does NOT use the Bootstrap plugin.
