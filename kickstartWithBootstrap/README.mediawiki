__NOTOC__
== Introduction ==
Kickstart is an extension for Grails in order to start your project with a good looking frontend. It is intended to be used in rapid application scenarios such as a Startup Weekend or a prototyping session with a customer.
This plugin provides adapted scaffolding templates for standard CRUD pages using the Bootstrap web page template by Twitter. Additionally, Kickstart includes some general GSPs pages (e.g., about.gsp), a minimal logging/orientation Filter, and a language switcher.

Currently, Kickstart is intended to act more like an injection than an plugin - importent files are copied into your project and you can remove the plugin afterwards. 

== Usage ==
After installation you can call the script "grails kickstartWithBootstrap" which will copy several files into your project. 
It will overwrite only few files (e.g., in conf, src, and views) - '''you should use it only on fresh new Grails projects'''. 

Afterwards create your domain classes (or copy them into the project) and generate contollers and views - they will
now use the Bootstrap framework!


== Notes ==

* Uses a vertical responsive Bootstrap 2.0 template (with some graphics from 1.4)
* Does only use plain Bootstrap (currently, without Less).
* The plugin copies the files into your project - you can uninstall the plugin thereafter.
* It does NOT use the Bootstrap plugin.
