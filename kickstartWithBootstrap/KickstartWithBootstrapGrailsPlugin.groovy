<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Kickstart is an extension for Grails in order to start your project with a good looking frontend. 
It provides adapted scaffolding templates for standard CRUD pages using the Bootstrap web page template by Twitter.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>After installation you can call "grails kickstartWithBootstrap" which will copy several files into your project. 
It will overwrite only few files (e.g., in conf, src, and views) - you should use it only on fresh new Grails projects. 
</p>
<p>Afterwards create your domain classes (or copy them into the project) and generate contollers and views - they will
now use the Bootstrap framework!
</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, only tested with Grails 1.3.7!</li>
<li>Does only use plain Bootstrap (currently, without Less).</li>
<li>The plugin copies the files into your project - you can uninstall the plugin thereafter.</li>
<li>It does NOT use the Bootstrap plugin.</li>
</ul>
